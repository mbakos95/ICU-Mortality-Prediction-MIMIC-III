# ICU-Mortality-Prediction-MIMIC-III-
This project focuses on predicting 30-day ICU mortality using clinical discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III dataset. The goal is to evaluate different deep learning architectures for text classification, leveraging both custom trainable embeddings and pretrained GloVe embeddings.
